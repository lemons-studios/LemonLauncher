## 🛠️ Running from source
First, run the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## 🚀 Deploying
It is recommended to deploy using Netlify or Vercel because they support Next.js apps and handle the builds for you.  

But if you want, you can also deploy on a different hosting service or self-host
1. Build the project with
```sh
npm run build
```
2. Then serve static build with
```sh
npm start
```
